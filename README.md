# WCF Utils
A small library that handles WCF package development utility functions for you. Automatically checks your cwd for a `.wcfutil.yml` which serves as a configuration file for the tasks that you want to run.

## Installation
Run `npm install -g wcf-utils` to install the package globally and have it added to your PATH.

## Usage
Create a `.wcfutil.yml` in your working directory and run `wcfutils`.

Examples for the configuration file can be found in `examples/` and will be further documented at a later point.
